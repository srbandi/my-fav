  <p>Baking is one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
  <p>Baking allows me to be creative, which I enjoy. </p>
  <p>I can choose to follow the recipe exactly as written, or I can change the recipe by adding new ingredients.</p>
  <p> The second reason why I like to bake is because the entire process of baking is fun for me.</p>
  <p>I love to go to the grocery to shop for ingredients, and then combine them all together to make a product that many people enjoy.</p>
  <p>Being able to sharing things that I bake is another reason why I enjoy this hobby. </p>
  <p> Many of my friends look forward to the tasty treat that I share with them.</p>
  <p>These are just a few of the reasons why I enjoy baking.</p>
